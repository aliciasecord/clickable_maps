Clickable maps of Michigan and Metro Detroit

####Michigan Counties Map
Each county is defined as a clickable <area> with class = county name. They correspond to <div class="county name"> which show when the county is clicked on the map or the name of the county is clicked in a list.
CSS is responsible for styling the page, not the map.
Javascript delivers the information when you click on the map.
